# Booklist
Vanilla JS Booklist project using DOM manipulation techniques

1. Add a book title, author and isbn
2. Displays the added book in a list under the submission form
3. Persists the added books in the local storage so the form isn't black upon DOM reloading
4. Remove book and update the local storage 
5. Use JS ES6 classes to formulate all the functions
